Tailoring interfaces in heterostructured electrocatalysts is an optimal strategy for improving the electrocatalytic performance, yet determining which active center to adjust is still extremely challenging. Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a novel heterostructured electrocatalyst of MnSxO2−x/MnCo2S4. The density and structure of the active centers were fine-tuned by controlling the S-O atomic ratio on the surface of MnSxO2−x. Consequently, the optimized MnS0.10O1.90/MnCo2S4 sample had excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance, with overpotential of 367 mV @ 50 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. More impressively, in 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution, the overpotential @ 10 mA cm−2 is only 414 mV. Furthermore, as the air–cathode catalyst in neutral zinc-air batteries, MnS0.10O1.90/MnCo2S4 exhibited excellent stability with the round-trip efficiency decaying by only 3.8% at 10 mA cm−2 after 140 h. Theoretical calculations revealed that Mn-Co site has the suitable binding affinity to the oxygen-containing intermediates, neither too weak (Mn site) nor too strong (Co-Co site), while MnCo2S4 endows the oxidized CoMnO active species a tensile strain that decreases the overpotential. This study opens an avenue for developing high-performance and durable heterostructure electrocatalysts toward OER, metal-air batteries in neural electrolytes and beyond.
