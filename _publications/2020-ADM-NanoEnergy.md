Rechargeable batteries have significantly helped to effectively use renewable energy sources as well as to intensively expand the electrification of vehicles. To achieve such goals, new advanced materials are urgently required. Atomically dispersed materials (ADMs) with single-atom metals supported on substrates feature uniform metallic sites and represent the utmost utilization of atoms, demonstrating wide applications in catalysis. These structural and morphological characteristics also make ADMs attractive materials for rechargeable batteries. Herein, we highlight and summarize the recent advances in synthetic methods for ADMs by physical confinement and chemical bonding. Subsequently, we summarize the recent progress in the design of diverse ADMs for lithium metal, lithium-sulfur, sodium-sulfur, lithium-oxygen, and zinc-air batteries and unveil the corresponding roles of ADMs from atomistic perspectives. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this field are discussed.
